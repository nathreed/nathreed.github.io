I am Nathan Reed. In my day job, I am a software engineer currently working on iOS applications. I have a wide variety of technical interests in addition to iOS development, including programming languages and compilers, operating systems, hardware from a high level, software reverse engineering, security, and more.  Iâ€™m very curious, always learning, and interested in a wide variety of nontechnical subjects, including transportation (especially aviation), cities, maps and geospatial stuff, and politics and government.
